weLEARN is a mobile application designed to assist students in an easy and seamless transition from the classroom to an online environment. The hope behind delivering this app is in assisting students with an easier time when managing their academic studies, as well as creating a community of like-minded people for whom you can learn about and get to know along the way. This was achieved by delivering multiple pages such as a forum, chatbot, chatroom and profile page all of which are entirely personal through an account based system. This application was built with ReactJS and multiple other technologies under the umbrella of Google Firebase.
